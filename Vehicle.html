		<p>A vehicle (from Latin: vehiculum<a href = "#title-1">[1]</a>) is a machine that transports people or cargo. 
		 Vehicles include wagons, bicycles, motor vehicles (motorcycles, cars, trucks, buses, mobility scooters for disabled people),
		railed vehicles (trains, trams), watercraft (ships, boats, underwater vehicles), amphibious vehicles (screw-propelled vehicles, hovercraft),
		aircraft (airplanes, helicopters, aerostats) and spacecraft.<a href = "#title-2">[2]</a></p>
		<p/>
		<p>Land vehicles are classified broadly by what is used to apply steering and drive forces against the ground:
		wheeled, tracked, railed or skied. ISO 3833-1977 is the standard, also internationally used in legislation,
		for road vehicles types, terms and definitions.<a href = "#title-3">[3]</a></p>
